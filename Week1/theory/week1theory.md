# Week 1 Theory: Algorithms and Discrete Math

There are textbooks devoted to both algorithms, and various sub-fields of discrete math. Those will be helpful, and I do recommend you peruse [CLRS](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443852050&sr=8-1&keywords=CLRS) for algorithms, and [an intro to mathematical thinking](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Thinking-Problem-Solving-Proofs-2nd/dp/0130144126/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443852165&sr=8-1&keywords=mathematical+thinking+problem-solving+and+proofs+2nd+edition) for discrete math. In the meantime, there is some basic math which you should be aware of. 


### Discrete Math

1. You need to know what sets are. They are collections of *things*.
2. You need to understand what Big-O notation is. It's a way of comparing functions asymptotically.


### Algorithms

A computer is well modeled by an abstraction called a Turing machine. A Turing machine has some set of states, some fixed memory to work with, the ability to read a character from a location in memory, and the ability to write a character to a location in memory. As such, computers operate mostly by processing data - reading it, changing it, storing it again. This means that it's very important to be able to:

1. Quickly find what you're looking for (search)
2. Organize things to make that easier (sort)

Most of our basic algorithms are devoted to solving these two problems well. There are more complicated tasks ahead, but for now these suffice.

Here are some tasks to help you get rolling. This week we're focusing on getting the environment set up, learning a bit of git, a bit of Java, and a bit of algorithms theory.

### Theory
1. Read the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) on sets.
2. Read the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) on Big-O notation.
3. Read the [Wiki page] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) on hash tables.
4. Go through the [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) lesson on algorithms. 

### Application

1. Install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
2. Clone this [git](https://git-scm.com/) repo into a local directory.
3. Make your own branch to work on, named YOUR_NAME-week1
3. Open the week 1 project in IntelliJ, and run the Runner class
4. Make a calculator class, and implement add, subtract, multiply, and divide on integers
5. Make a phonebook class, and implement adding people to the phonebook, removing them, and looking them up. Try it with lists, and also with maps. Think about which you should use, and why. Try and write some tests which show you the difference in behavior. (Hint: back of the envelope calculation to figure out how much stuff you need for a slowdown). Be prepared to explain to me the difference between a list and a map, and internally, a LinkedList vs an ArrayList, and a HashMap vs a TreeMap. Questions allowed.
6. Push your local branch to the repo
7. Issue a pull request, for me to review

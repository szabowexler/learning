# The Art of Conquering Problems (with Computers)
## Elias Szabo-Wexler

### Introduction

People who work with computers have many names - data scientists, softare engineers, computer scientists, hardware engineers, etc. However, they are unified by a common theme - the use of computers to solve problems. At a high level of abstraction, computer science is the study and classification of problems which can be solved by computers. The computer scientist requires a grounding in mathematics (both discrete and continuous), an understanding of algorithmic principles, and a desire to solve problems.

### Objectives

This course is intended to assist the dedicated novice in transitioning from uninitiated to fledgling software engineer. It is therefore focused on imparting the two essential tools of the software engineer: rudimentary coding ability, and rudimentary grasp of algorithmic principles.

### Structure

Software engineering and computer science are best learned by application. This course will mix theory with application, and frequently link to external resources. The student is strongly advised to follow along, think about the theory, but above all, apply it constantly.
